## API Documentation

To view the list of available APIs and their specifications, run the server and go to `http://localhost:3000/v1/docs` in your browser. This documentation page is automatically generated using the [swagger](https://swagger.io/) definitions written as comments in the route files.

### API Endpoints

List of available routes:

**Post routes**:\s
`GET /v1/posts` - get all posts\
`GET /v1/posts/:postId` - get post by id\

**Snippet routes**:\s
`GET /v1/snippets` - get all snippets\
`GET /v1/snippets/:snippetId` - get snippets by id\

## Error Handling

The app has a centralized error handling mechanism.

Controllers should try to catch the errors and forward them to the error handling middleware (by calling `next(error)`).

```javascript
const catchAsync = require('../utils/catchAsync');

const controller = catchAsync(async (req, res) => {
  // this error will be forwarded to the error handling middleware
  throw new Error('Something wrong happened');
});
```

The error handling middleware sends an error response, which has the following format:

```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Not found"
}
```

When running in development mode, the error response also contains the error stack.

The app has a utility ApiError class to which you can attach a response code and a message, and then throw it from anywhere (catchAsync will catch it).

## Validation

Request data is validated using [Joi](https://joi.dev/). Check the [documentation](https://joi.dev/api/) for more details on how to write Joi validation schemas.

The validation schemas are defined in the `src/validations` directory and are used in the routes by providing them as parameters to the `validate` middleware.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const validate = require('../../middlewares/validate');
const userValidation = require('../../validations/user.validation');
const userController = require('../../controllers/user.controller');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/users', validate(userValidation.createUser), userController.createUser);
```

## Logging

Import the logger from `src/config/logger.js`. It is using the [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logging library.

Logging should be done according to the following severity levels (ascending order from most important to least important):

```javascript
const logger = require('<path to src>/config/logger');

logger.error('message'); // level 0
logger.warn('message'); // level 1
logger.info('message'); // level 2
logger.http('message'); // level 3
logger.verbose('message'); // level 4
logger.debug('message'); // level 5
```

In development mode, log messages of all severity levels will be printed to the console.

In production mode, only `info`, `warn`, and `error` logs will be printed to the console.\
It is up to the server (or process manager) to actually read them from the console and store them in log files.\
This app uses pm2 in production mode, which is already configured to store the logs in log files.

Note: API request information (request url, response code, timestamp, etc.) are also automatically logged (using [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)).

## Linting

Linting is done using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io).

In this app, ESLint is configured to follow the [Airbnb JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base) with some modifications. It also extends [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) to turn off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.

To modify the ESLint configuration, update the `.eslintrc.json` file. To modify the Prettier configuration, update the `.prettierrc.json` file.

To prevent a certain file or directory from being linted, add it to `.eslintignore` and `.prettierignore`.

To maintain a consistent coding style across different IDEs, the project contains `.editorconfig`
